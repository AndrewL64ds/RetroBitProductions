         <h1>Breaking News! Strange Monsters Around the City</h1>

      <p>Recently, sightings of strange monsters have reportedly increased across the city. There are conflicting reports on the appearance of these monsters, but one trait that is common to all of them is the presence of the color yellow and the smell of citrus. A lucky photographer managed to take a photo of one of them.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the photo wasn't in focus, so we can’t quite make out what it looks like. We’ll post more updates if we find more information in the coming days. For now, it is recommended to <a href="index.html">return to where you came from</a>.</p>
      <h2>Update</h2>
      <p>We have recently received a witness account of a civilan's encounter with one of the monsters near a local gas station. Apparently, these monsters have the ability to change their appearance to blend in, as the monster was disguised as the civilan it encountered. The monster didn't opt to attack the civilan and things seemed very peaceful. Sadly, the witness was not able to provide more details, such as the civilan's name, nor any photos.</p>
