      <h1>SA64's Digital Site Journal</h1>
      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p>So, it’s already been a week of production of the site. Admittedly, I’ve been procrastinating on resuming my work on the site, but I’ve finally decided to get to work… at 11:30pm… don’t judge me. I decided to make this page as a sort of journal for working on this site. I'm not planning on having it be accessible, so no-one should notice unless they look at the repo for the site.</p>
      <p>I'm very glad everyone at the studio liked the proof of concept I made of the site, it gave me a lot of confidence that I could actually do this. Unfortunately, they decided to revise the branding of the studio before I started working on the site, so I had to fix it. They still haven't sent me the new logo yet... so I guess I have to use the old one when I show them the progress...</p>
      <p>Right now, I’m writing all the text that will be featured on the website. Figured getting all the text out of the way would help me with finalizing the site layout. I’ll have Emerald take a look at the text later to make sure it fits the studio’s vibe. I know I’ve been working with them for a while, so I should know this, but you can’t be too safe.</p>
      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>Once again, I procrastinated on working on the site. The team gave me a good amount of critiqute about the site, namely the inconsistent use of color. I easily managed to fix it.</p>
      <p>I tried to do the tasks I set aside for myself, but I ended up doing a bunch of other different things that I also need to do for the website... maybe I should tweak my tasks. One thing I said I was going to do was to start coding the About Us page. Now, while I have started working on it, it is nowhere near done.</p>
      <p>Edit: Decided to go back and fix some of the grammar mistakes I made since I remembered that a few were pointed out.</p>
